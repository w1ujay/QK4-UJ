# K4 Protocol Quirks — Canonical Reference

This document catalogs non-obvious K4 CAT behaviors that shape the QK4 code base. Each quirk has a *symptom*, the *K4 behavior* that causes it, and *where QK4 encodes the workaround* (with file:line so a maintainer can trace it).

Sources: every behaviour here was verified by driving a K4/0 server directly over a Python socket and reading what came back — QK4's own code is never the source of truth for this document. Raw session transcripts are kept in the maintainer's private notes; the findings, not the transcripts, are what this file records.

---

## 1. `$` suffix convention

**Symptom.** Same command, two variants: `MD` / `MD$`, `BW` / `BW$`, `RO` / `RO$`, `RT` / `RT$`, `#REF` / `#REF$`, etc.

**K4 behavior.** Commands with a `$` suffix act on the **sub receiver (VFO B)**; without the suffix, they act on the main receiver (VFO A). This applies to both queries and set commands.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/models/radiostate.cpp` — the handler registry. See preamble comment in `registerCommandHandlers()` (file top of that function). Registry sorts **longest prefix first** so dispatch correctly prefers `RO$` over `RO`. Each `$` variant typically updates a `*B` member and emits a `*BChanged` signal.
- `src/models/radiostate.h` — class-level Doxygen comment documents the convention.

**Rules for new parser work.** Add the `$` variant's entry **before** the base variant in the registry (longer-prefix-first), and update/test both.

---

## 2. `RO` vs `RO$` RIT/XIT offset routing

**Symptom.** Setting an XIT offset sometimes ends up in `RO`, sometimes in `RO$`, depending on split / BSET state. Raw RU/RD adjust a register whose identity depends on the current mode.

**K4 behavior (verified by direct socket session):**
- No split, RIT or XIT active → offset lives in `RO`  (VFO A).
- Split + XIT (TX on VFO B)  → offset lives in `RO$` (VFO B).
- BSET + RIT                 → offset lives in `RO$` (VFO B).

`RU;` / `RD;` (increment/decrement) adjust *whichever register is currently active* and echo that register's name back (`RO` or `RO$`). `XT/;` (toggle) echoes `XT1;`/`XT0;`, but `XT1;` / `XT0;` (set) do *not* echo. `RC;` clears `RO`; to clear `RO$` send `RO$+0000;`.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/models/radiostate.cpp` — `RO$` handler at the inline lambda near L1095 (documented inline); `RT$` at L1112; base `RO`/`RT` handlers later in the registry.
- UI consumption: see MainWindow's RIT/XIT box + BSET-aware routing.

**Gotcha.** When testing via direct socket, make sure QK4 is not also connected to the same K4 — interleaved commands confuse the test.

---

## 3. `SL` (streaming latency) is not echoed

**Symptom.** You send `SL3;` to the K4; the K4 accepts it silently; the UI never updates from any response.

**K4 behavior.** The K4 applies the new SL tier but does not echo an `SL<n>;` response. There is no query form that returns the current tier either. The tier → packet-size map was verified by socket session: four distinct tiers, bundling 20 / 40 / 60 / 120 ms of audio per packet.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/mainwindow.cpp::onRadioReady` — after the `RDY;` dump, QK4 sends its configured `SL` tier *and* calls `m_radioState->parseCATCommand("SL<n>;")` optimistically so RadioState (and everything downstream — AudioEngine frame sizing, the UI menu) matches what we just requested. Long comment block there explains why this post-RDY override is necessary.
- Tier changes at runtime (from the radio manager dialog) go through `ConnectionController` → `RadioState::streamingLatencyChanged`, which AudioController listens to for TX Opus frame-size reconfiguration.

---

## 4. `TX;` / `RX;` control

**Symptom.** `TX;` and `RX;` from WSJT-X / MacLoggerDX need to drive QK4's internal PTT state and TX audio gate — not just forward to the K4.

**K4 behavior.** `TX;` puts the radio in transmit; `RX;` returns it to receive. These are the canonical PTT commands over CAT.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/network/catserver.h` — `CatServer::pttRequested(bool)` signal emitted on parsed `TX;`/`RX;` from external CAT clients.
- `src/mainwindow.cpp` — `sendCAT("TX;"|"RX;")` for internal PTT button flows at `:2601`; the disconnect path sends `RX;` (`:93`) to unlock both the K4 and QK4's internal gate.
- Tests: `tests/test_catserver.cpp` covers the `TX;` / `RX;` → `pttRequested` pathway end-to-end over a real TCP loopback socket.

---

## 5. Iambic latch semantics (internal keyer quirk)

**Symptom.** Brief Iambic-A paddle taps would drop the character if naïve latch handling were used.

**K4 behavior.** Not a K4 quirk — a keyer-state-machine quirk. Iambic A terminates the character immediately when both paddles are released; Iambic B emits one more element. With atomic paddle state read off the hardware thread, the keyer's element-timer fire can race a paddle-release that already happened.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/hardware/iambickeyer.cpp::enterElement` (~L96) — clears **only** the just-consumed paddle's latch, preserves the opposite-paddle latch. Long WHY comment there explains the Iambic-A correctness argument.
- `src/hardware/iambickeyer.h` — class-level Doxygen points readers at this quirk.

See section 8 below for the KZ keying protocol that carries these elements to the K4.

---

## 6. Packet framing: 4-byte marker + 4-byte length + 4-byte end

**Symptom.** TCP reads can land mid-packet; the parser has to reassemble across boundaries.

**K4 behavior (K4/0 server side).** All audio / spectrum / CAT data is wrapped in fixed frames:
`[START_MARKER (0xFE 0xFD 0xFC 0xFB)] [big-endian u32 payload length] [payload] [END_MARKER (0xFB 0xFC 0xFD 0xFE)]`.
Markers are mirror-imaged so corruption can't alias one for the other.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/network/protocol.h` — class/namespace header comment documents the frame format.
- `src/network/protocol.cpp::parse` — the **"keep last 3 bytes"** branch when no marker is found is load-bearing: `START_MARKER` is 4 bytes; if a TCP read delivered 1–3 of those bytes, dropping them would lose sync on the next read. Inline WHY comment.
- Buffer overflow recovery: `K4Protocol::MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 1 MB` cap at `protocol.h:32`; overflow clears the buffer and warns.

---

## 7. ARP cold-start retry (transport layer, not protocol — keep in mind)

Not a protocol quirk but a startup-reliability one worth mentioning alongside:

**Symptom.** First connect from a freshly-launched QK4 (after Finder launch / `open` command) fails synchronously with `EHOSTUNREACH` on macOS.

**Cause.** macOS `connect(2)` returns `EHOSTUNREACH` immediately when the ARP cache has no MAC for the destination IP. The ARP request *is* sent; the reply just lands too late for that first `connect()`.

**QK4 encoding.** `src/network/tcpclient.cpp`, in the socket-error handler — retry after 500 ms, up to 2 attempts, via the named constants `kArpRetryIntervalMs` and `kArpMaxRetries`. Not a workaround; correct handling of a real network transient.

---

## 8. KZ keying protocol

Sidebar — not directly a protocol *quirk*, but non-obvious enough to belong here.

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KZ.;` | dit element (1 dit on) |
| `KZ-;` | dah element (3 dits on) |
| `KZ ;` | letter space |
| `KZP####;` | pause N ms before the next element (fist preservation) |
| `KZL##;` | element length in ms (`1200 / WPM`) |
| `KZD####;` / `KZU####;` | raw key-down / key-up for N ms. K4/0 uses this form for real-time paddle forwarding; QK4 does not |

**The byte between `Z` and `;` in the letter-space form is 0x20, a literal SPACE.** Confirmed by
hexdump of EP02 traffic from a live KPOD+. Elecraft's `KPodKeyerInterface.pdf` v1.00 renders it as
`KZ_;`, which looks like an underscore and is a typographic artifact — sending a real underscore
(0x5F) does **not** work.

Undocumented contest behaviour (confirmed by N6TV): inside an element-form string such as
`KZ-.-. --.-  -.;`, one blank is a 3-dit letter space and **two blanks are a 6-dit word space** —
tighter than the ITU 7-dit default.

QK4 emits these from `IambicKeyer` on its own high-priority thread, wired to the socket in
`CwController`; see `src/hardware/README.md` for the keying chain.

## 9. PAN spectrum tiers — the radio picks the bandwidth, not the span

The K4 always sends **1024 bins**, whatever span you ask for. What changes is the bandwidth those
bins cover, chosen by the radio from five tiers. `sampleRate` in the PAN packet is in **kHz**, and
`tierSpanHz = sampleRate * 1000`.

| Tier | `sampleRate` (kHz) | Tier span | Switches up at | Switches down at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 24 | 24 kHz | — | ≤ 19 kHz |
| 2 | 48 | 48 kHz | 20 kHz | ≤ 36 kHz |
| 3 | 96 | 96 kHz | 37 kHz | ≤ 82 kHz |
| 4 | 192 | 192 kHz | 83 kHz | ≤ 172 kHz |
| 5 | 384 | 384 kHz | 176 kHz | — |

The up and down thresholds differ deliberately — that hysteresis stops the tier oscillating when you
sit on a boundary. All 1024 bins are usable; there is no edge taper or filter rolloff to mask.

**Why it matters to QK4.** A stored waterfall row is only meaningful alongside the tier it was
captured at: the same 1024 bins mean 24 kHz of spectrum in tier 1 and 384 kHz in tier 5. The
renderer windows every row with one tier value, so `PanadapterRhiWidget` clears the waterfall when
`sampleRate` changes — otherwise a tier change would silently redraw all history at the wrong
frequency scale.

## 10. Span dial skips 6 kHz going up

Stepping **up** from 5 kHz the K4 jumps to 7 kHz. Stepping **down** it walks 7 → 6 → 5 in normal
1 kHz steps, so 6 kHz is reachable descending but skipped ascending. The K4 advertises 6 kHz as its
minimum span. Step size is 1 kHz from 5–144 kHz and 4 kHz from 144–368 kHz.

**QK4 does not currently replicate the skip** — `RadioUtils::getNextSpanUp` applies a flat 1 kHz
step below the threshold, so it lands on 6 kHz where the radio would not.

## 11. Audio encode modes `EM0`–`EM3` carry the same audio at different numeric scales

**Symptom.** The four encode modes sound like different volumes. Switching from EM3 to EM0 needs far
more mic gain to reach the same ALC. EM1 transmits audible noise while the operator is silent.

**K4 behavior.** Three facts, all measured 2026-09-19 against a stationary reference — dummy load,
**AGC OFF**, fixed AF gain, 20 s of receiver noise captured in each mode with
`tools/k4_audio_capture.py` (capture `bench-logs/audiocal-20260919-0741`, 240,000 samples/mode):

1. **EM0 is 24-bit audio in a 32-bit container.** Its full scale is `2^23`, not the `2^17` QK4
   previously assumed. The K4's EM0 stream carries exactly **256× (2^8)** the values of its EM1
   stream for the same sound — a bit shift, which is why the ratio is exact rather than approximate.
2. **EM1, EM2 and EM3 are all shipped at an identical level** — 16.780 / 16.710 / 16.718 on a `2^15`
   scale for the same signal. EM2 and EM3 are the *same Opus bitstream*; they differ only in which
   decode call the client uses (`opus_decode` vs `opus_decode_float`), not on the wire.
3. **Every mode is shipped ~32× below its container's full scale.** That factor is a property of the
   radio, not of any codec, and it is independently corroborated: K4-Companion, an unrelated
   implementation, applies the same 32× to the same stream.

Elecraft's documentation calls EM0 "RAW 32-bit float". It is neither float nor scaled to 2^31 — it is
S32LE integers holding 24-bit values. Taking the documentation at its word is what produced AUD-003.

**QK4 encoding.**
- `src/audio/opusdecoder.h` / `.cpp` — one rule for all four modes:
  `out = native × K4_GAIN_BOOST / full_scale`, with full scale `2^23` (EM0), `2^15` (EM1/EM2) and
  `1.0` (EM3). This replaced four unrelated by-ear constants, two of which were wrong by 6 dB in
  opposite directions. Under the corrected rule the modes agree to **0.04 dB**; before, they spanned
  **12.03 dB**.
- `src/audio/rawaudioformat.h` — `EM0_FULL_SCALE` (`2^23`) is the single source of truth, shared by
  the TX side so the two directions cannot drift apart. `EM0_S16_TO_FULL_SCALE` (256) maps a captured
  S16 mic sample onto EM0's full scale; anything less caps TX below full modulation with no way to
  recover it, because `setMicGain` clamps at unity and can only attenuate.
- `tests/test_opusdecoder.cpp` — pins the rule. Five of its eight cases fail on the pre-calibration
  constants, including the 12.03 dB EM0-vs-EM1 spread.
- `tests/test_rawaudioformat.cpp` — pins the TX wire format and scale.

**Reproducing it.** `tools/k4_audio_capture.py capture ...` then `analyze`. AGC **must** be off: AGC
normalises level and erases the quantity being measured. The modes cannot be compared simultaneously
because `EM` is only applied at connect (it is sent in the startup macro), so the method relies on a
stationary reference instead — captures minutes apart are comparable when the signal is receiver
noise into a dummy load.

**A second, independent defect on the same path.** Mic gain was applied and the signal quantised to
S16 *before* the wire format was chosen, so every mode inherited a 16-bit bottleneck and lost bits in
proportion to the attenuation — at a 30% mic slider only ~10.8 bits survived, and EM0 carried 16 bits
shifted into its 24-bit container. Undithered quantisation error at that depth correlates with the
signal, so it is harmonic distortion rather than noise. On the bench this was a tonal buzz on dead
air at low mic gain that vanished completely at 50% and above — a level-dependent *character* change,
which is what distinguishes it from any acoustic or preamp noise. The path now stays Float32 and
quantises once, at the wire format.

**Still unmeasured.** TX levels for EM2/EM3; whether the K4 requires *stereo* Opus on TX (QK4 sends
mono; K4-Companion duplicates to stereo and its author notes the K4 requires it).

## How to extend this document

Add a new section only when a behavior satisfies **all** of:
1. A direct socket-session test confirms the behavior (QK4 alone cannot be the source of truth).
2. QK4 encodes a workaround or decision based on it (file:line reference required).
3. The behavior is non-obvious from reading the code alone.

Each section must cite the file where the workaround lives. Prefer naming the function or constant
over a line number — line numbers rot silently, and a stale one sends the reader to unrelated code.

Do **not** add sections for generic CAT commands whose behavior is documented in Elecraft's official programmer's reference.
