# Tracing the HaliKey → KZ CW pipeline

A diagnostic recipe for investigating CW-keyer reports such as "extra dits at high
speed" on HaliKey (MIDI or V1.4). Captures the path from physical paddle edge through
the IambicKeyer state machine to the `KZ` bytes that hit the K4 over TLS.

## What gets logged

Two logging categories carry the relevant traces:

| Category | Source | Lines you'll see |
|---|---|---|
| `cw.keyer` | `src/hardware/iambickeyer.cpp` | `KEYER@HH:mm:ss.zzz [DIT down] ...`, `[ELEM start DIT] ...`, `[TIMER fired wasDit=1] ...`, `[PAUSE emit] ...`, `[IDLE]` |
| `cat.tx` | `src/network/tcpclient.cpp` | `TX@HH:mm:ss.zzz [ KZ.; ]`, `[ KZ-; ]`, `[ KZP0180; ]`, `[ KZ ; ]` (KZ-prefixed CAT only) |

The KPOD+ EP02 path also logs in the same `TX@` format via `hw.kpodplus` (`KZ@`)
and `cat.tx` (`TX@`); you can use the same recipe to A/B a KPOD+ session against a
HaliKey session of the same character at the same WPM.

## Enabling the trace

Run the app with:

```bash
QT_LOGGING_RULES="cw.keyer.debug=true;cat.tx.debug=true" \
  /Users/mikegarcia/development/QK4/build/QK4.app/Contents/MacOS/QK4 \
  2>&1 | tee /tmp/qk4-cw-trace.log
```

The category is off by default — when disabled, `qCDebug` short-circuits at the
category check so there is zero hot-path cost.

## What a clean "C" looks like at 20 WPM

A single character `C` (dah-dit-dah-dit) on a HaliKey MIDI paddle, with iambic
sending, should produce a trace pattern like this (timestamps shortened):

```
KEYER@... [DAH down] state=Idle  physD=0 physA=1 latchD=0 latchA=1
KEYER@... [PAUSE emit] elapsed=420ms                          ← (if any gap from last char)
KEYER@... [ELEM start DAH] interval=240ms ...
TX@...    [ KZP0420; ]                                        ← restartAfterPause emit
TX@...    [ KZ-; ]                                            ← elementStarted emit
KEYER@... [DIT down] state=PlayingDah ...                     ← squeeze begins
KEYER@... [TIMER fired wasDit=0] liveD=1 liveA=1 ... → both held → alternate
KEYER@... [ELEM start DIT] interval=120ms ...
TX@...    [ KZ.; ]
KEYER@... [TIMER fired wasDit=1] ... → both held → alternate
KEYER@... [ELEM start DAH] interval=240ms ...
TX@...    [ KZ-; ]
KEYER@... [DAH up] state=PlayingDah ...
KEYER@... [DIT up] state=PlayingDah ...
KEYER@... [TIMER fired wasDit=0] ... → squeeze-release IambicA → idle
KEYER@... [IDLE]
TX@...    [ KZ ; ]                                            ← characterSpace emit
```

Wire output (extract just the `TX@` lines): `KZP0420; KZ-; KZ.; KZ-; KZ ;` —
whose command forms are tabulated in `docs/k4-protocol-quirks.md` → "KZ keying protocol".

## What an "extra dit" looks like

A phantom dit will show up as a `[TIMER fired ...] → ...` line where the latch was
set but the live paddle was already released. Specifically: look for

```
KEYER@... [DIT down] state=PlayingDit ...                     ← graze during active element
KEYER@... [DIT up]   state=PlayingDit ...                     ← release ≤ a few ms later
...
KEYER@... [TIMER fired wasDit=1] liveD=0 liveA=0 latchD=1 ... → same-paddle repeat dit
KEYER@... [ELEM start DIT] ...
TX@...    [ KZ.; ]                                            ← the extra dit
```

The signature is **`liveD=0 ... latchD=1` followed by a `same-paddle repeat dit`** decision.
That's the iambic memory latch converting a mid-element graze into an extra element.

If the trace shows no such pattern but the user still reports an extra dit, the
problem isn't in the keyer — look at the K4's reproduction of a correctly-emitted
stream, or at local sidetone bleeding back through the audio capture path.

## Correlating across categories

`KEYER@` and `TX@` use the same `HH:mm:ss.zzz` wall-clock format. A diff between
the timestamp of `[ELEM start DIT]` and the following `TX@... [ KZ.; ]` is the
end-to-end latency from keyer-thread emit decision to TCP wire write — typically
sub-millisecond, but useful for diagnosing event-queue backups under load.

## Tracing the V1.4 serial layer (Windows / paddle edges)

To debug the serial-read layer *below* the keyer (raw modem-control pins → dit/dah/ptt
edges), enable the `hw.halikey` category:

```powershell
$env:QT_LOGGING_RULES = "hw.halikey.debug=true;cw.keyer.debug=true;CAT.TX.debug=true"
$env:QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING = "1"   # Windows GUI app: force logs to stderr (see below)
$env:QT_MESSAGE_PATTERN = "%{time process} %{category}: %{message}"   # add timestamps
.\build-qt67\Release\QK4.exe 2> qk4-cw-trace.log
```

You'll see `HaliKeyV14Worker: raw pins CTS:.. DCD:.. DSR:..` on every line transition and
`dit/dah/ptt edge: true|false` when a debounced edge is emitted. The V1.4 pin mapping:
`CTS` = dit lever / foot pedal (demuxed by mode in `CwController`), `DCD‖DSR` = dah lever.

> **Windows logging gotcha.** Qt's default handler only writes to stderr if it thinks a
> console is attached. When you redirect stderr to a *file* (a pipe), `GetConsoleMode`
> fails and Qt silently routes everything to `OutputDebugString` instead — your log file
> stays empty. Set `QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING=1` to force it to the redirected handle.

> **Note:** the category strings are case-sensitive — it is `CAT.TX.debug=true`
> (not `cat.tx`).

## Windows serial monitor: why it polls, not WaitCommEvent

`HaliKeyV14Worker::monitorLoop()` uses a different I/O model per platform: Linux blocks on
`TIOCMIWAIT`, macOS polls `ioctl(TIOCMGET)` every 500 µs, and **Windows polls
`GetCommModemStatus` every ~1 ms** (high-resolution waitable timer).

Windows originally used `WaitCommEvent` (block until `EV_CTS`/`EV_DSR`/`EV_RLSD` fires).
**Do not go back to that.** USB-serial (FTDI etc.) VCP drivers do **not** reliably deliver
modem-status change events: a paddle-line transition with no other line activity often
fails to wake `WaitCommEvent` at all. The symptom is a stuck key — a release is never
seen, so the keyer auto-repeats until some *unrelated* line change (e.g. the next press)
belatedly wakes the loop. Captured signature: a dah `hold=2559ms` that "released" only
when the next CTS press arrived, with **zero `raw pins` lines** in between. Polling reads
the lines unconditionally each tick, so every transition is caught within one poll period
regardless of driver event support. (Bounce defense is the same count-based
`DEBOUNCE_COUNT` filter on all three platforms; the 8 ms hold gate in `IambicKeyer` is the
secondary defense.)

## Extra elements: the split-release signature

Symptom reported by operators: an occasional element nobody sent, heard in the sidetone, on the
wire, or both. Sidetone and the KZ stream share one trigger (`IambicKeyer::elementStarted`), so an
extra element in either means an extra `enterElement()` — always a keyer-side fault, never the
sidetone generator.

The cause was that the paddle levers reached the keyer as two independent events. Releasing a
squeeze then straddled an element boundary: the timer sampled with one lever still down, the
"both released" guard missed, and the cross-paddle branch appended an element. In Iambic A that is
always wrong — A must stop at the element boundary.

Signature to look for in `cw.keyer.debug`:

```
KEYER@... [TIMER fired wasDit=1] liveD=0 liveA=1 latchD=0 latchA=1 squeezed=1 mode=A → cross-paddle dit→dah
```

`squeezed=1` with `mode=A` and exactly one of `liveD`/`liveA` still 1, taking a `cross-paddle`
branch instead of `squeeze-release IambicA → idle`, followed by an element the operator did not
key. Cross-check the `hw.halikey` `lines` entries either side of it: two entries a millisecond or
two apart, each dropping one lever, is a release that was delivered split.

This cannot happen on the serial variant any more — `readPinState()` samples every line at once and
that sample now travels intact to `IambicKeyer::setPaddleState`, which writes both levers in one
store. The MIDI variant sends one note per lever, so a squeeze release is genuinely two messages
there; the keyer always sees a coherent pair, but the two messages can still land either side of a
boundary. If the signature above reappears, it should only ever be on MIDI.

## Disabling cleanly

`unset QT_LOGGING_RULES` or omit the variable. Nothing else is needed.
