# QK4-UJ

> **Fork of [QK4](https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4)** by Mike Garcia (KF5O) — a cross-platform desktop application for remote control of Elecraft K4 radios over TCP/IP with real-time audio streaming and spectrum display.

This fork (maintained by Jay Corriveau, W1UJ) adds RFKit amplifier support, a compact Mini View window, CatServer extensions for N1MM Logger+ and hardware controllers, and keyboard and mini-pan tuning. See [Fork Changes](#fork-changes-uj-branch) below and [CHANGELOG-UJ.md](CHANGELOG-UJ.md) for details.

## Download

Upstream QK4 releases are on the [QK4 Releases](https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4/releases) page; they don't include this fork's changes.

QK4-UJ Windows builds come from the on-demand [Build Windows](https://github.com/w1ujay/QK4-UJ/actions/workflows/build-windows.yml) workflow: run it on the `ujay-mods-v2` branch and download the artifact from the finished run. The window title shows the build's version, for example `QK4-UJ ujay-mods-v2-1a2b3c4`.

### Windows Prerequisite

None — the Visual C++ runtime ships inside the package.

### Linux x86_64 (Flatpak)

One bundle runs on any distribution with Flatpak — no per-distro packages.

```bash
# Install Flatpak (if not already installed)
sudo apt install flatpak

# Add the Flathub repository
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# Install QK4
flatpak install QK4-<version>-linux-x86_64.flatpak

# Install the udev rules — required for KPOD / KPOD+ USB access
sudo curl -o /etc/udev/rules.d/99-kpod.rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeg-dal/QK4/main/resources/99-kpod.rules
sudo chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/99-kpod.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Run QK4
flatpak run io.github.mikeg_dal.QK4
```

After installation you can also launch QK4 from your application menu.

The Flatpak packaging was contributed by [@CSVincentS](https://github.com/CSVincentS)
(see [#96](https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4/issues/96) and
[#127](https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4/pull/127)), with the original packaging approach
and PipeWire tuning from [@jmeloranta](https://github.com/jmeloranta)'s Arch AUR build.

### Raspberry Pi Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a desktop environment (X11 or Wayland)
- Debian Trixie or Ubuntu 24.04+
- **First run requires `sudo`** — the launcher (`run.sh`) installs a udev rule to grant non-root access to the Elecraft KPOD and KPOD+ USB devices. Without this rule, the Linux kernel restricts access to `/dev/hidraw*` and USB device nodes. After the first run, `sudo` is no longer needed. If you don't have a KPOD or KPOD+, `sudo` is not required.

brew install qt opus openssl@3 hidapi libusb cmake

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4.git
cd QK4
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt)"
cmake --build build

# Run
./build/QK4.app/Contents/MacOS/QK4

# Create distributable app bundle (optional)
cmake --build build --target deploy
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Install vcpkg dependencies
vcpkg install opus:x64-windows hidapi:x64-windows openssl:x64-windows libusb:x64-windows

# Install Qt 6.7+ via Qt Online Installer or aqtinstall
# Required modules: Multimedia, ShaderTools, SerialPort, Svg

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4.git
cd QK4
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run
.\build\Release\QK4.exe
```

### Linux / Raspberry Pi

```bash
# Install dependencies (Debian Trixie / Ubuntu 24.04+)
sudo apt install cmake g++ pkg-config file patchelf \
  qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev \
  qt6-multimedia-dev qt6-shadertools-dev qt6-serialport-dev qt6-svg-dev \

cd QK4
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Run
./build/QK4
```

### Linux x86_64 (Flatpak)

Builds the same bundle CI produces, without needing the Qt dev packages above —
the KDE SDK supplies them.

```bash
# Install flatpak-builder and the KDE runtime
sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//6.10 org.kde.Sdk//6.10

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mikeg-dal/QK4.git
cd QK4
flatpak-builder --user --install build-dir flatpak/io.github.mikeg_dal.QK4.json

# Run
flatpak run io.github.mikeg_dal.QK4
```

A local build tracks the `main` branch and reports its version as `main`; CI
overrides both to pin the released commit and stamp the real version.

## Testing

QK4 includes a unit test suite built with the Qt Test framework. Tests run automatically in CI on every push and PR.

```bash
# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

# Build and run only tests (no GUI dependencies needed)
cmake --build build --target test_radiostate test_radioutils test_protocol test_catserver
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

| Suite | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **RadioState** | 34 | CAT command parsing: frequency, mode, power, filters, notch, lock, split, edge cases |
| **RadioUtils** | 28 | Shared utilities: tuning steps, band detection, span stepping |
| **Protocol** | 14 | K4 binary packet framing, routing, roundtrip, overflow recovery |
| **CatServer** | 26 | TCP CAT server: GET responses, SET forwarding, PTT, multi-command |

## Usage

1. Launch QK4
2. Click the **globe icon** on the left side panel to open the Radio Manager
3. Enter your K4's IP address
4. **For encrypted connection**: Check "Use TLS", enter your PSK, port auto-sets to 9204
5. **For unencrypted connection**: Leave TLS unchecked, port defaults to 9205
6. Click **Connect**

Once connected, the application displays real-time spectrum, audio, and radio state from your K4.

## Architecture

```
Radio (TCP:9204 TLS / 9205 unencrypted) → TcpClient → Protocol → RadioState / DSP Widgets
                                                               ↓
                                                        OpusDecoder → AudioEngine → Speaker
Microphone → AudioEngine → OpusEncoder → Protocol → TcpClient → Radio
```

## Fork Changes (UJ Branch)

Key additions in this fork, rebuilt on upstream v0.7:

- **RFKit Amplifier** — HTTP client with a readout panel and floating window, a status-bar indicator, and a drive-power lockout that puts the amplifier in standby when K4 power exceeds a set maximum. Settings page under Options.
- **Mini View** — Compact dual-VFO window (MINI button) with an optional mini panadapter and DX spot strip. Tune with the arrow keys or the mouse wheel over a frequency.
- **CatServer (port 9299)** — Extended for N1MM Logger+ and hardware controllers
  - `$`-suffix commands (`MD$`, `BW$`, `RG$`, `AG$`) and RF gain adjust (`RG+`/`RG-`/`RG/`)
  - RIT (`RU`/`RD`/`RC`) and VFO step (`UP`/`DN`/`UPB`/`DNB`) pass-through
  - Keyer buffer (`KY;`, `TB;`), sub-receiver status (`SB;`), and `PB;`
  - `AG`/`AG$` mapped to QK4's local volume sliders
- **Keyboard Tuning** — Up/Down tunes the active VFO by the tuning step (VFO B with B SET), respecting VFO lock; Up/Down on a digit during frequency entry tunes by that digit's place value
- **Mini-Pan Right-Click** — Right-click a VFO mini-pan or the Mini View pan to tune VFO B there, with CW pitch and RIT handled
- **Tuning** — VFO and panadapter wheel tuning snap to the step grid and respect VFO lock
- **Antenna** — RX ANT and SUB ANT buttons work over the network
