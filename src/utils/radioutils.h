// queue trim itself back down. They are expressed as MULTIPLES OF THE CURRENT
// PACKET SIZE (one decoded K4 SL-bundle) — never fixed milliseconds — so the
// buffer scales with the operator's chosen SL tier: SL0's 20ms packets get a
// small buffer, SL7's 120ms packets get a proportionally larger one. A fixed-ms
// target would sit below one packet at high SL and drop every packet.

// --- K4 panadapter fixed-tune display mode ---------------------------------
// The K4 encodes the panadapter tuning mode across two CAT params: #FXT
// (0=track, 1=fixed) and #FXA (0-4). WARNING: Elecraft uses TWO naming
// systems and they do NOT line up intuitively. The programmer's reference
// names #FXA by behavior; the front panel shows different labels. We mirror
// the front-panel labels (what the user sees on the radio), verified against
// hardware 2026-05-28:
//   #FXA  reference name       front-panel label (what QK4 shows)

//    4    SLIDE NEAR EDGE      SLIDE2
//   (#FXT0 = TRACK, regardless of #FXA)
// WHY centralized: the inbound parse and the outbound command builder must
// agree, or the displayed mode desyncs from the radio (the historical
// SLIDE1<->FIXED2 bug, caused by mis-associating the two naming systems).
