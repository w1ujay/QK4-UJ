//
// Implemented: the init burst, audio_start/audio_stop, RX and TX audio with TX_CHRONO pacing, the
// sensor echoes, and the CAT sets a digital-mode client needs - vfo, dds, modulation, trx (PTT) and
// split_enable. Everything else the burst declares is answered READ-ONLY from the snapshot by
// answerReadOnly: the matching SETs move real hardware and are deferred until they can be benched.
// An unhandled TCI command is silence, not an error, so deferring them is safe. See
// docs/tci-server-design.md, phase 8.
//
// Thread affinity: create, start and drive this on the thread that owns it. It is not thread-safe.
