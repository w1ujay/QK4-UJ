// A LIST, unlike every other builder here, because the K4 takes at most 60 characters per KY and a

// K4's command rather than in the caller. Not padded: the padding other Elecraft drivers use
// guards against a short KY following a keyer abort, which is a flow QK4 does not have.
//
// `wait` selects the KYW form on the LAST chunk, which delays the radio's processing of following
// host commands until the message has been sent. Pass it when a KS follows, which is the use the
// manual names. Do NOT pass it otherwise: it stalls everything QK4 sends afterwards - polling

// as data in the DATA modes. In SSB, AM and FM it is DISCARDED IN SILENCE - no keying, no error, no
// response of any kind. Confirmed on a K4: with the radio in LSB, a correctly formed KY produced
// nothing at all.
//
// A K4 fact, so it lives beside the command it describes. QK4 does NOT change the mode on the
// strength of it - that would be a surprising side effect of a text command - it only says so in
// the log, which is the only place the silence can be explained.

// WHY THESE TWO EXIST ALONGSIDE noiseBlanker() AND filterBandwidth() BELOW.
//
// The pair below build REPLIES to a CAT client (catserver.cpp, catpushbroadcaster.cpp). They have
// never been used to send anything TO the radio, and neither is in the K4's actual command form:
// noiseBlanker() emits "NB1;" where the K4 wants NBnnm, and filterBandwidth() emits the width in
// Hz where the K4 wants 10-Hz units. Both are pre-existing reply-direction bugs, reported
// separately rather than changed here - altering them would change what every existing CAT client
// on port 9299 is told.
//
// These two are for SENDING, and match what QK4's own UI already sends by hand
// (sidecontrolscrollcontroller.cpp divides the bandwidth by 10; featuremenucontroller.cpp uses the
// NB/ toggle).

// NBnnm: nn is the level 00-15, m is on/off. The level is preserved by the caller, because TCI's
// RX_NB_ENABLE is on/off only and must not silently move the level.
// NBnnm, or NBnnmf when filterWidth is given (0-2). Pass filterWidth < 0 to leave it off the
// command and change only the level and the on/off flag.
