// RFC 6455 server transport. Knows nothing about TCI.
//
// Accepts connections, completes the HTTP upgrade, and turns the byte stream into whole messages
// using WebSocketDecoder. Answers PING with PONG and echoes CLOSE itself; everything else is
// surfaced as a signal.
//
// WHY hand-rolled instead of Qt6::WebSockets: that module ships with Homebrew Qt but is absent from
// the Linux, Windows and flatpak dependency sets, so adopting it means editing five upstream-owned
// files for one feature. The server subset is small and Qt6::Network is already a dependency. See
// docs/tci-server-design.md.
//
// Thread affinity: create and start() this on the thread that will own it. QTcpServer and its
// sockets are not thread-safe, so every public method must run on that thread — the TCI thread,
// per the design. Callers on other threads marshal with QMetaObject::invokeMethod.

    // RFC 6455 5.5.2 requires a peer to answer PING with PONG, so this uses the mechanism the
    // protocol already defines rather than inventing one. ANY inbound frame counts as proof of
    // life, not just the PONG, so a busy client is never probed into a false positive.

    // The timeout is generous on purpose. The cost of being wrong is asymmetric: dropping a live

    // limit on any buffer fed by an external source; this is the one direction that had none.
    //
    // Two limits, because audio and control must not be treated alike. Past the soft limit audio
    // frames are DROPPED: for a live stream, late audio is worthless and dropping is the correct
    // response, where queueing is not. Control frames are small and carry state a client cannot
