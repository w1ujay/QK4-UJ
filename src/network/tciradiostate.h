// The radio model the TCI server answers from.
//
// WHY a snapshot rather than a RadioState pointer: RadioState is main-thread-only and CI-enforced
// (CONVENTIONS.md rule 4), and its getters carry no locking. The TCI server runs on its own
// thread, so it keeps its own copy, fed by queued signals. Building the init burst from one pass
// over this struct also keeps it self-consistent - RadioState emits per-field signals with no
// batch boundary, so live reads could seed a client with a frequency and mode that never
// coexisted.
//
// SPLIT INTO TWO RECEIVERS, which is the whole point of this file existing separately.
//
// TCI has two axes and they carry different things:
//
//   * CHANNEL (A/B within a receiver) carries ONLY frequency and audio - vfo, rx_channel_enable,
//     rx_volume, rx_balance, vfo_lock, rx_channel_sensors.
//   * TRX (receiver) carries everything else - modulation, rx_filter_band, agc_mode, rit/xit,
//     sql, the DSP flags, lock, drive.
//
// The K4's Sub RX has its own mode, filter, AGC, RIT and S-meter, so it is a RECEIVER in TCI's
// sense, not a channel. Modelling it as channel 1 (the first attempt) left every one of those
// settings with nowhere to live: `modulation` has no channel argument, so VFO B's mode could not
// be reported at all. ExpertSDR3's channels A/B are two tuning points inside one receiver's
// passband, which is a different thing from a second receiver.
//
// Channel 1 of receiver 0 keeps its other job - the split transmit VFO. On a K4 that is the same
// VFO B the Sub RX tunes, so both mappings point at one piece of hardware, which is correct.
