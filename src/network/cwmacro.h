// Prosigns are left in TCI's |XX| form deliberately. How a prosign is SPELLED is a K4 fact
// (KY maps '(' to KN, '+' to AR and so on), and this file is the TCI side of the wall the design
// draws: the TCI layer never spells a K4 command. CatFrames::cwText does that translation.

// Three things are embedded in what looks like plain text, and ALL THREE MUST BE CONSUMED HERE

// destructive meaning inside a KY command:
//
//   > and <   TCI: raise/lower sending speed by 5 WPM, cumulative.
//             K4 KY: '<' puts the radio into TX TEST MODE until a '>' is received. Forwarding a
//             speed marker would take the transmitter off the air mid-message.
//   |XX|      TCI: run letters together as one prosign.
//             K4 KY: '|' quickly terminates TX in FSK/PSK.
//   ^ ~ *     TCI's escapes for : , and ; - the characters its own framing reserves.
