// What QK4 claims to support. nfm is deliberately ABSENT: the K4 has one FM mode and no narrow
// variant, so advertising nfm would offer a mode the radio cannot enter. A client that sends nfm
// anyway is still understood as FM - see k4ModeFor.

// What `device:` reports: the program name, a space, then the version.
//
// WHY THE VERSION IS THERE. `protocol:` cannot identify QK4 - it deliberately says ExpertSDR3 so
// WSJT-X is happy - so `device:` is the only field naming the program, and without a version a
// client cannot tell a QK4 that supports something from an older one that does not. TR4W asked for
// exactly that, to gate a capability on the server it is talking to.
//
// SPACE-SEPARATED SO THE NAME IS STILL A PREFIX. A client matching "QK4" at the start keeps working
// whatever the version becomes; an equality match was always going to break on the first release
// anyway. No client observed here reads this field at all - TR4W logs it and discards it - so the
// compatibility risk is in what WSJT-X does, and WSJT-X matches on `protocol:`, which is untouched.
//
// QK4_VERSION is defined for the application target only (CMakeLists.txt:409). The test targets
// compile this file without it, hence the fallback rather than a build break.
