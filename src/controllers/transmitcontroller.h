/**
 * @brief The single owner of "are we transmitting".
 *
 * Every producer — the PTT button, XMIT, the Esc key, a CAT client, a TCI client, and the radio
 * itself — asks this controller instead of writing the audio gate and the indicator by hand. It
 * holds a TransmitOwner::State, and executes the TransmitOwner::Effects each decision returns.
 *
 * WHY it exists: before it, seven call sites wrote the PTT indicator and five independently wrote
 * the audio gate, only one of them put TX;/RX; on the wire, and no disconnect path released
 * anything. AUDIT.md calls that the G1 violation; AUD-001, INT-001 and INT-002 are symptoms.
 *
 * The decision itself lives in models/transmitowner.h so it can be unit-tested without an audio
 * device or a socket. This class is only the execution half: ordering, marshalling and signals.
 *
 * Threading: main thread only. Every caller is already on main — CatServer's readyRead, TciServer's
 * queued hop into TciController, the widget signals — and AudioController marshals to the audio
 * thread itself.
