 *        SidetoneGenerator (sidetone thread). Translates KPOD button presses → macroRequested
 *        for MainWindow dispatch.
 *
 * CW-keying orchestration (IambicKeyer + HaliKey paddle wiring, the V1.4 PTT demux,
 * the KPOD+ keyer-active gate, sidetone playback) lives on CwController — see
 * cwcontroller.h. HardwareController constructs and owns the devices + threads;
 * CwController wires their CW behavior together via injected pointers.

    // that don't belong on a generic controller façade. Wrapping all of this in
    // HardwareController would inflate its surface area without collapsing any
    // cross-controller coupling. Same shape as ConnectionController::tcpClient().
