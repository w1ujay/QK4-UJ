/**
 * @brief Owns the audio thread + AudioEngine + Opus decoder. Task-level API over the RX/TX paths:
 *        startAudio/stopAudio, PTT toggle, atomic volume/mix/balance setters. Connects to
 *        RadioState.streamingLatencyChanged to resize TX Opus frames in step with the K4's SL tier.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   - AudioEngine is moved to `m_audioThread` (single moveToThread at construction).
 *   - OpusDecoder keeps main-thread affinity but is only called from the IO-thread lambda
 *     wired to Protocol::audioDataReady — effectively single-threaded on the IO thread.
 *   - The TX encode pipeline (OpusEncoder + packet framing) lives on AudioEngine and runs
 *     fully on the audio thread (PR 12). AudioController only forwards PTT toggles and SL
 *     tier changes; the audio thread emits txPacketReady straight to TcpClient::sendRaw.
 *   Public AudioController methods are safe to call from the main thread (they dispatch via
 *   QMetaObject::invokeMethod / atomics).
