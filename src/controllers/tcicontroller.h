/**
 * @brief Owns the TCI thread, the TCI server and the audio bridge. Task-level API only.
 *
 * TCI lets an external program (WSJT-X and friends) reach the K4 through QK4 for both control and
 * audio, replacing the virtual serial port plus loopback sound card arrangement. This controller is
 * the seam between that server and the rest of the app.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   - TciServer and TciAudioBridge are moved to `m_tciThread` at construction and never touched
 *     directly from another thread; every public method here marshals.
 *   - RX audio arrives from AudioController::rxAudioAvailable on the I/O thread and crosses to the
 *     TCI thread by queued connection, so resampling is paid off the I/O thread - which also
 *     carries the K4 control stream.
 *   - RadioState is NOT read from the TCI thread. It is main-thread-only and CI-enforced
 *     (CONVENTIONS.md rule 4); the server keeps its own snapshot instead.
 *
 * The listener is off unless started. An always-on port would change behaviour for every user of
 * the app, and nothing else in QK4 opens a socket without being asked.
 *
 * See docs/tci-server-design.md.
