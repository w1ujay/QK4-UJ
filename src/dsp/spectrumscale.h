// Amplitude axis for the panadapter: where a given dBm sits on screen, and which values earn a
// label. Pure arithmetic with no Qt widget dependency so it can be tested directly — the bug that
// prompted it (S1 printed at two different heights) was arithmetic, and only reachable through the
// UI before this was split out.
//
// The K4 reports REF in dBm and SCALE in dB, so the visible window is [REF, REF + SCALE] and every
// value here is absolute dBm. S-units follow the amateur convention: S9 = -73 dBm, 6 dB per unit
// below it, 10 dB steps above.

// 9.0 + dBoverS9/10 - so S9+20 arrives as 11.0, not 29. Converting that with sUnitDbm() would
// clamp it to S9 and silently discard every strong signal, which is why this is its own function
// rather than a cast at the call site.
